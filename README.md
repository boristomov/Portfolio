# Portfolio

Full-stack/ML/Robotics engineer who ships end-to-end products. I can build web/mobile apps (React, React Native, Node, Django), design and deploy cloud backends (AWS, SQL), and deliver computer-vision and ML systems (OpenCV/MediaPipe, PyTorch/TensorFlow). Experienced in embedded/controls for robotics (ESP32, FreeRTOS, PD/PID) and CV-driven teleoperation. Comfortable with rapid prototyping, data pipelines, and taking products from UX to production.

Looking to prove my skills at your company and learn quickly. I am very quick self-learner and can adapt to different workflows and engineering fields.
